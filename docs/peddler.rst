Peddler development
===================

Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

Start by cloning the Peddler repository::

    git clone https://github.com/alto9/peddler.git
    cd peddler/

Install requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

Run tests
~~~~~~~~~

::

    make test

Yes, there are very few unit tests for now, but this is probably going to change.

Code formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Peddler code formatting is enforced by `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. To check whether your code changes conform to formatting standards, run::

    make test-format

And to automatically fix formatting errors, run::

    make format

Static error detection is performed by `pylint <https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. To detect errors, run::

    make test-lint

Common developer tasks
----------------------

Generating the ``peddler`` executable binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    make bundle

Generating the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip install -r requirements/docs.txt
    cd docs/
    make html

You can then browse the documentation with::

    make browse

Releasing a new version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Bump the ``__version__`` value in ``peddler/__about__.py``.
- Replace "Unreleased" by the version name and date in CHANGELOG.md.
- Create a commit with the version changelog.
- Run ``make release``: this will push to the default repo/branch for the current branch.

.. _contributing:

Contributing to Peddler
-----------------------

Third-party contributions to Peddler and its plugins are more than welcome! Just make sure to follow these guidelines:

- Open a pull request on the `Peddler repository <https://github.com/alto9/peddler/pulls>`__ or the corresponding plugin.
- Make sure that all tests pass by running ``make test`` (see above).
- If your PR is in the Peddler core repository, add an item to the CHANGELOG file, in the "Unreleased" section. Use the same format as the other items::

    - [TYPE] DESCRIPTION

Where "TYPE" is either "Bugfix", "Improvement", "Feature" or "Security". You should add an explosion emoji ("üí•") before "[TYPE]" if you are making a breaking change.

- Write a good Git commit title and message: explain why you are making this change, what problem you are solving and which solution you adopted. Describe your use case. We *love* long, verbose descriptions :) As for the title, `conventional commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org>`__ are preferred. Check the repo history!

Happy hacking! ‚òòÔ∏è
